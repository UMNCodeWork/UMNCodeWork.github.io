      <p class="term-desc">
        Code and the people, companies, and institutions writing, regulating, and designing it are inventing more ways for software to make suggestions about our everyday tasks, but what ethical considerations are not being addressed? This first Code Work event creates an opportunity for two scholars from different disciplines to discuss the ethical issues surrounding the increasingly long reach of software into our everyday lives.
