excerpt: Computer Scientist <a href="http://www.uphi.umn.edu/about/faculty/barry/" target="_blank">Phillip Barry</a> (University of Minnesota) and Digital Rhetorician <a href="http://jamesjbrownjr.net/" target="_blank">James Brown, Jr.</a> (Rutgers University-Camden) will discuss the ethical issues surrounding code exploits, the increasingly long reach of software into the everyday lives and practices of both programmers and users, and how they think their disciplines are poised to approach such issues.

---

Code and the people, companies, and institutions writing, regulating, and designing it are inventing more ways for software to make suggestions about our everyday tasks, but what ethical considerations are not being addressed? This first Code Work event creates an opportunity for two scholars from different disciplines to discuss the ethical issues surrounding the increasingly long reach of software into our everyday lives.
