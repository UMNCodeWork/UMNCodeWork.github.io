### "No video" event basics
This is an event *without* a video.  It will not include an embedded YouTube video or IRC chat.  

To make it more visually appealing, it *will* include an embedded Google Map of the event location.  The Google Map will pull from the "map_address" tag in the frontmatter,
so make sure you include a well-formatted address there.  (You may want to try a Google Maps search on your address string, just to make
  sure it actually yields the result you're expecting.)

The "location" tag in the frontmatter *will not* affect the embedded map.  It is for informational purposes only, so you can include things like
room numbers, building names, etc. to help people find the event.
