Stanford has created an interesting joint major program, partnering Computer Science (CS) with X discipline, including English. Students in a particular discipline take advantage of this program by finding an advisor in each department, and explore the relationships between the disciplines by pitching a project to guided them through their curriculum (see the <a href="https://stanford.box.com/shared/static/tc16uhimfgc1fexzd7km.pdf" target="_blank">student proposal form</a>).
